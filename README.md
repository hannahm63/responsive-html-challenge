# Responsive HTML/CSS Challenge

This is my interpretation of a basic webpage depicted in a screenshot. 

For reference, I included the orginial screenshot at the end of this file 

## Process

To get started, I took a mobile-first approach by breaking down the components on the page and creating a diagram of how I believe it would look on a mobile device. 

This is a portion of the diagram I came up with: 

![Mobile Diagram](mobile-diagram.png?raw=true "Mobile Diagram")

I then built out the structure of the HTML file, adding all of the major elements and then moved on to styling it.


## Tools Used

This page uses a CSS grid layout, flex box, and media queries to facilitate responsiveness across various screensizes and mobile devices.
